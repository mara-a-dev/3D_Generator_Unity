# 3D_Generator_Unity

This is 3D shape generator created with Unity 3D / C#

The scene shows a rotating 3D cube (default) shape, 2 controllers (icons) and a save button.

- Clicking on the first controller (coloring brush) will change the color of the active shape "randomly".
- Clicking on the second controller (shapes icon) will change the shape "randomly" into one of these (cube, sphere,cone), and you will see a log message that notifies you of the new shape's name.
- Clicking on the (Save) button will create a miniture of the active shape along with its color (without the rotation movement), and place that miniture on the left of the screen and start filling the screen with shape minitures whenever the save button is clicked. The location of these minitures is calculated to fit into the screen and to leave a space among those minitures.
